# Compiling and Running a Single Java File

## 1. Naming the class

When compiling single files, you can name the class however you like, but do not declare it public. 

## 2. Open Command Prompt

On Windows, open the Command Prompt (cmd).

## 3. Compile the Program

To compile the program, type the following command and hit **Enter**:

```bash
javac "First Java Program.java
```

After compilation, the .java file gets translated into the .class file (bytecode).

## 4. Run the Program
Now we can run the program. To run it, type the following command and hit Enter:

```bash
java FirstJavaProgram
```

Note: Do not append the ".class" extension to the file name while running the program.
