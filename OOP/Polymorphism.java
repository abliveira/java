Polymorphism is an important concept of object-oriented programming. It simply means more than one form.

That is, the same entity (method or operator or object) can perform different operations in different scenarios.

Why Polymorphism?
Polymorphism allows us to create consistent code. In the previous example, we can also create different methods: renderSquare() and renderCircle() to render Square and Circle, respectively.

This will work perfectly. However, for every shape, we need to create different methods. It will make our code inconsistent.

To solve this, polymorphism in Java allows us to create a single method render() that will behave differently for different shapes.

We can achieve polymorphism in Java using the following ways:
    Method Overriding
    Method Overloading
    Operator Overloading

class Polygon {

  // method to render a shape
  public void render() {
    System.out.println("Rendering Polygon...");
  }
}

class Square extends Polygon {

  // renders Square
  public void render() {
    System.out.println("Rendering Square...");
  }
}

class Circle extends Polygon {

  // renders circle
  public void render() {
    System.out.println("Rendering Circle...");
  }
}

class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    
    // create an object of Square
    Square s1 = new Square();
    s1.render();

    // create an object of Circle
    Circle c1 = new Circle();
    c1.render();
  }
}
